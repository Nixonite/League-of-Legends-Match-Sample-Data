# League-of-Legends-Match-Sample-Data
League of Legends Match History data for 800 players.

It comes with a python file for retreiving more, and uses the RiotWatcher python module found <a href="https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher">here</a>.
I used my own developer api key so you'll have to get your own (free).

It took about 1.5-2 hours to fetch it all. Have fun.
